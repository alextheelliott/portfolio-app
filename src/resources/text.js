export const aboutMe = `Hello, I'm Alex. I'm 22 years old and currently studying Mechatronics Engineering (BASc) at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I have experience with building consulting and automotive engineering, working at AME Group and Magna International respectively. I am also a member of UBC's Formula Electric team and was a member of UBC's Uncrewed Aircraft Systems team for 2 years. I am a FIRST Robotics and SHAD alumni. I'd like to research and explore the fields of Machine Learning and Robotics as I grow and explore my career. I am excited to explore new topics and delve into exciting projects.`
